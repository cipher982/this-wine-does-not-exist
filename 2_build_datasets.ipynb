The palate is bright, concentrated and dense with plenty of structured tannins buttressed by French oak. The result is a well integrated, nuanced and complex wine.',\n",
       "  'Rombauer Vineyards was founded in 1982 by Koerner and Joan Rombauer and sits on a tree covered knoll overlooking the Napa Valley. The winery features caves that extend for over a mile into the hillside. The caves provide a constant temperature and humidity which result in optimum conditions for aging our wines.',\n",

       "  'This wine reflects the up and coming Shiraz vineyards of the Barossa, rather than the battle hardened old vines which make up the core of our other cuvee’s. Full of freshness and bright youthful fruits, the 2017 vintage brings elegance and class to the wines. Aromatic blackberries and raspberries with freshness and balance, the wine has a round central core of red fruit that gives way to a complex mid-palate full of cassis, dark cherry, spice, and vanilla. While offering immense pleasure in its youth, the 2017 Woodcutter’s Shiraz will certainly develop into an impressive wine with a few more years in the cellar. A fantastic introduction to the Torbreck range.',\n",
       "  \"The 2015 Pommard Pinot Noir is Bargetto's fourth release of Pommard Clone wine. The color is garnet with lively bright and fruity aromas. Fresh cranberries, warm rhubarb pie, clove, rosemary, and hints of vanilla bean and toasted oak fill the nose. Aromatic hints of earth, mushroom and minerality show off the unique terroir of the Santa Cruz Mountains and add a layer of intrigue to the wine. The palate is lively and balanced with ripe raspberry flavors and refreshingly clean acidity. This wine is medium-bodied with delicate layers of fruit, spice and sweet oak that linger on the finish. \",\n",
       "  'A classic, Provençal style rose with pale salmon coloring and super low phenolic extraction. Texturally soft, delicate and fresh, it pairs well with a broad variety of summer fair, especially grilled meats and vegetables, and is astonishingly refreshing served icy cold in the heat of the day. Vivid floral aromas dominate the aroma, with sweet raspberry and watermelon fruit in the mouth.',\n",
       "  'Merlot is one of the main Bordeaux varietals and grows well in Paso Robles. This brick red Merlot has a full nose of blueberries, dried cherries, and boysenberries framed by dark chocolate and baking spices. The mouth begins with cranberries and plums and finishes with medium tannins and moderate vanilla oak.

He first started his domaine in 2003, and undertook the ultimate labor of love in the Languedoc—planting a vineyard. For many years, this plot of land was best known for olive trees, until the great frost of 1956 decimated groves by the hundreds. The land is hard as a rock, quite literally, and composed primarily of limestone and clay. To plant a vineyard here is a game of patience and incredibly hard work. Over the last few years, Cyriaque has been slowly building stone terraces to better protect this challenging terrain from erosion. In addition, he has taken to farming biodynamically, a noble task that forgoes the shortcuts that most vignerons have at their disposal today in favor of producing organic grapes in a rich, healthy soil. In total, he works 4.5 hectares, which are planted with forty-year-old Cabernet Sauvignon vines, as well as Syrah, Grenache, Mourvèdre, Carignan and Cinsault.

Deep in the Southwest corner of the country lies Department 66, which serves as the inspiration and namesake for our winery and vineyards in the town of Maury. Roughly two hours east of Barcelona, Spain and thirty minutes inland from the ancient Roman port city of Perpignan, old vine Grenache thrives along with Syrah and Carignan in the \"Cotes Catalanes;\" a sub-appellation of the Roussillon. We own and maintain 300 acres (120 hectares) of vineyards among the Pyrénées-Orientales mountain range, which were planted more than 60 years ago. The terroir is dominated by black schist, with small deposits of granite and limestone in red, rocky soils known as angile. Similar to the nearby growing region of Priorat in Spanish Catalonia, schist is a crystalline rock based soil that retains heat well but is poor in organic nutrients and nitrogens. Apart from lowland scrub, “garrigue,” and sparse tree plantings, very little agriculture survives here. The intense heat from the daytime sun is reflected back to the gnarled, head trained vines at night, increasing ripeness while maintaining acidity. The result is a very low yield (half ton per acre), but makes for a dark, concentrated, and finesse driven wine that embodies this singular region. General Manager Richard Case and Vineyard Manager &amp; Cellarmaster Bob Doyle continue to make this dream a reality since 2008.',\n",
       "  \"Although historical records mention Vesuvio as early as 1565 it was primarily under the auspices of the Douro's redoubtable widow, Dona Antónia Adelaide Ferreira, that this vineyard estate acquired its legendary reputation. The estate's industrious founder was her husband who from 1820 began the ambitious task of planting the vineyard. This gargantuan enterprise involving the shaping and construction of terraces on the intractable slopes and the planting of hundreds of thousands of vines took his legions of workers thirteen years to complete. Following the founder's death, his widow continued to develop the property, which under her able management became the showpiece quinta of the Douro. At Vesuvio she built one of the Douro's largest wineries, containing eight granite 'lagares' (treading tanks) each capable of holding 25 pipes (1 pipe: 550 litres). In 1989 Quinta do Vesuvio was purchased by the Symington family whose involvement in the growing, production and shipping of Port began more than a century ago. The family decided from the outset to preserve the traditional character of the Quinta especially with regard to the vinification process where the time-honored method of treading the grapes by foot has been retained. Some technological innovations have been introduced principally in the form of a cooling system to control fermentation in this ancient wine making method. In view of the outstanding quality of the wine, Vesuvio is offered exclusively as a single Quinta Vintage Port. Only about 50 pipes (36,000 bottles) are bottled each year although the production of the property is much greater and this exemplifies the family's steadfast policy of releasing none but the very finest wines from the Quinta.\",\n",
