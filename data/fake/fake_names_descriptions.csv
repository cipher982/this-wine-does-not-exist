7021,Gleighlidg Peipa Riesling 2013,"""The name refers to the white grapes found on the terraces above the soil. Since vines hailing from a high altitude area, the slopes are more precisely oriented to the east and in the opposite direction to the prevailing winds. The wine is dry with a golden yellow color. It expresses good aromatic complexity, pleasant fruity, good acidity and an attractive, lingering finish.  Try it as an aperitif or with fish and salads, fried fish, spicy Asian cuisine, sushi and sashimi, Asian dishes and fresh seafood. """
7022,Bouchard Cleaui Sree Napa Vadiaglo 2005,"""Deep red color with garnet hues. The aroma is balsamic, ripe fruits, and oak. The taste is rich and well balanced. Blend: 98% Sangiovese, 2% Merlot, 1% Cabernet Franc """"It should drink well now, but drinking well now, it will show great ageability (even in 2000), thanks to a low yielding vintage. The bouquet is fruity and reminiscent of blackberries. With age, it will show additional complexity. I expect it to age well for at least 20 years.""""-Wine Advocate"" |startof"
