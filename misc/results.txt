This unique limited edition of Dom Pérignon Vintage 2008, designed by Lenny Kravitz, marks the second year of his collaboration with Dom Perignon.

The special Cristal glass was co-designed by Jean-Baptiste Lecaillon, Cellar Master of Louis Roederer and Philippe Jamesse, Head Sommelier at Les Crayères in Reims. It is produced in limited edition by renowned French glassmaker Lehmann. The unique shape and size allows Cristal its full expression.Cristal is Louis Roederer’s flagship cuvée. It was created in 1876 and is composed of Grand Crus from the Montagne de Reims, the Marne Valley and the Côte des Blancs. Cristal 2008 was bottle-aged for 8 years before being left to rest for at least 8 months after disgorging in order to attain perfect maturity.Amber hue with green and orange tints. Fine, even and lively sparkle. Complex and intense bouquet disclosing candied citrus, yellow fruit, Williams pear, pollen, and toasted almond. The delicately seductive bouquet shows intensity and well-honed precision. The wine is powerful, full yet tight, on entry to the palate. The 2008 is undeniably well structured but in a particular way: the wine's almost saline concentration has not been created by the sun, but is derived from the dryness of the chalk soil in a particularly cool summer. The result is a smooth, almost liquorous, mouthfeel that coats the palate with a powerful yet soft texture. This gives way to an incredible finish, underpinned by freshness and an impression of absolute purity with a taut and very saline character. The Cristal 2008 is deep, intense and masterful. It offers the quintessential reflection of its chalk soils which lend it is velvety texture and delicate tension. This wine’s energy has been tamed by an unusually long period of bottle ageing: Cristal 2008 was in fact aged for 10 years before its release on the market. A first!Blend: 60% Pinot Noir, 40% ChardonnayURL:/product/Laurent-Perrier-Cuvee-Rose/10521|DESC:The Cuvée Rosé from Laurent-Perrier is the most recognized rosé champagne in the world.

Held in an elegant bottle inspired by King Henri IV, it has been widely acknowledged for its consistent high quality for more that 40 years, and it is the benchmark for rosé champagne around the world.Laurent-Perrier Cuvée Rosé is truly remarkable for its highly expressive bouquet, stemming from very careful preservation of fresh fruit aromas during the wine making. Made with 100% Pinot Noir from 10 different "crus " (or villages), from the North and South areas of the Montagne de Reims, as well as the famous Cote de Bouzy. Grapes from carefully selected plots are meticulously sorted and de-stemmed before going into the vats, and the controlled maceration helps with the color extraction and the development of the full aromatic richness of the Pinot Noir.Intensely fruity flavors, clean and slightly sharp, the wine opens to the sensation of freshly picked red berries: strawberries, Morello cherries, black currants and raspberries.
